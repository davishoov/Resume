      <h3>Hello, My name is Davis Hoover</h3>
        <p>I am a student at the University of Southern California (FIGHT ON!)<br> majoring in Industrial Systems Engineering<br>
      and this is my online resume!</p>
      <br>
      <p>To introduce a little about myself, I am a transfer student from North Carolina State University
      where I was also planning to major in Industrial Systems Engineering with a concentration in Operations. My reason for transferring to USC was
      one filled with a desire to seek new cultural experiences, challenge myself in a more rigorous academic
      setting, and to further develop as a person.</p>

            <h3> About Me and My Major</h3>
              <br>
              <p>Industrial Engineering is an expansive major with many points of focus
              in areas of technology, finance, business development, market research and statistics.</p>
              <br>
              <p>My reason for choosing this major was one filled with careful thought. I knew what I was good at(math and science related fields),
              but I also knew what I was passionate about(sports and the culture sports breeds), and generally these two fields do not go hand-in-hand together.
              The diversity of Industrial Engineering I knew would be able to provide me
              the means the be able to use my strengths in an area that I am passionate about.
